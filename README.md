# Dart for Windows
This repo provides the community-supported installer for Dart SDK on Windows. [Dart](https://dartlang.org) is a modern, client-optimized programming language from Google that helps you craft beautiful, high-quality experiences across all screens.

![Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeKorm/dart-windows/master/installer-screenshot-no.png)

The installer downloads and installs the latest version of Dart from Google. Two different channels are available:
 - A stable channel, which provides the latest supported production-quality release. This channel is usually updated no more frequently than every six weeks.
 - A dev channel, which is lightly tested but contains the latest pre-release. This channel is usually updated on a weekly basis. 
 
In general, you should use the stable channel unless you have a specific reason to be running a pre-release build. More information on the [Dart channels can be found at the Dart website](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk#about-release-channels-and-version-strings).

Both 64-bit and 32-bit releases are available.
